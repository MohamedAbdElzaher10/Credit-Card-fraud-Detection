# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using various machine learning techniques. Given the sensitive nature of financial transactions, accurate detection of fraudulent activities is crucial. We explore and compare multiple models to find the best approach to address this challenge.

## Project Motivation

Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions and cardholders. Identifying fraudulent transactions is challenging due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones. This project explores various machine learning models to identify and prevent fraud effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 0.172% of transactions being fraudulent. It includes 284,807 transactions with 31 features.

- **Number of Rows:** 284,807
- **Number of Columns:** 31

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key libraries used:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `tpot`

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed an initial analysis to understand the dataset's structure and the distribution of values:

- Verified that there are no missing values.
- Observed the class imbalance, with a very small percentage of transactions labeled as fraudulent.
- Examined the distribution of features and relationships between them using visualization tools such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, the following steps were taken:

- **Scaling:** Features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to normalize the data, improving model performance.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Handling Imbalance:** Techniques like under-sampling and over-sampling were considered to address the class imbalance issue, though more advanced methods like SMOTE could also be employed.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models were evaluated for this task, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using TPOT**

The TPOT library was utilized for AutoML, automating the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning. TPOT's best model turned out to be a `LinearSVC`.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

A confusion matrix was also generated to give a detailed view of the model's performance in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Class Imbalance
- **Description:** The dataset is heavily imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up a very small portion of the data.
- **Solution:** We experimented with different techniques such as under-sampling the majority class, over-sampling the minority class, and using precision-recall metrics over accuracy to better evaluate model performance.

### Challenge: Model Selection
- **Description:** Selecting the best model for the task can be time-consuming and complex.
- **Solution:** We utilized the TPOT AutoML tool, which automates the selection of the best model and its hyperparameters.

## Conclusion

The project successfully identified fraudulent transactions with high accuracy using a LinearSVC model selected by TPOT. Despite the challenges posed by the class imbalance, the chosen model showed strong performance across various metrics.

## Future Work

- **Improvement of Imbalance Handling:** Explore advanced techniques such as SMOTE or ensemble methods designed for imbalanced datasets.
- **Real-time Detection:** Implement the model in a real-time system to detect fraud as it occurs.
- **Feature Engineering:** Investigate additional feature engineering techniques that could further enhance model performance.
